# AI API

## Description

This is some practice code I'm making to translate a LLM into a REST API to use with my personal website.

## Dependencies

I am using the following Python libraries (and their associated internal dependencies):

- langchain
- dotenv

## Usage

This is currently a private project and designed for my website. I will be attempting to generify it in the future. Details of how to run the code will be added here in the future
